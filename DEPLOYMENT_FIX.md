# 🔧 Deployment Fix Applied

## ❌ Previous Issue:
**"Deployment Failed: Failure during content distribution"**

## ✅ Root Cause:
Azure Static Web Apps deployment failed because we were using the newer Azure Functions v4 programming model, which isn't fully compatible with Static Web Apps deployment process.

## 🛠️ Fixes Applied:

### 1. **Converted Azure Functions to Traditional Model**
   - Changed from `app.http()` to `module.exports` pattern
   - Removed `@azure/functions` v4 dependency
   - Updated all three endpoints: `/api/health`, `/api/contact`, `/api/stats`

### 2. **Updated Configuration Files**
   - `host.json`: Changed extension bundle from v3-4 to v2-3 (more stable)
   - `package.json`: Removed v4 programming model dependencies
   - GitHub Actions: Added explicit `skip_api_build: false`

### 3. **Ensured Compatibility**
   - Functions now use the traditional context/req pattern
   - Response format changed to `context.res = { ... }`
   - Maintained all functionality (CORS, validation, error handling)

## 🚀 Expected Result:
- **Deployment should now succeed**
- API endpoints will be available at:
  - `https://polite-pond-08ff9450f.2.azurestaticapps.net/api/health`
  - `https://polite-pond-08ff9450f.2.azurestaticapps.net/api/contact` 
  - `https://polite-pond-08ff9450f.2.azurestaticapps.net/api/stats`

## ⏱️ Timeline:
- **Fixes committed**: ✅ Just pushed to main branch
- **Deployment starting**: Should begin automatically
- **Expected completion**: ~5-10 minutes

## 🧪 How to Test:
1. Wait for GitHub Actions to complete
2. Open `api-test.html` in your deployed site
3. Test each endpoint button
4. All should return JSON responses successfully

The traditional Azure Functions model is proven to work with Azure Static Web Apps, so this should resolve the deployment issue! 🎯
