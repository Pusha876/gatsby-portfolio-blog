## Manual Build Instructions

Since the terminal tool is having issues, here's how to build manually:

### Windows Command Prompt Method:
```cmd
1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator
2. cd "c:\WORKSPACE\azure-static-web-apps\gatsby-portfolio-blog"
3. npm run clean
4. npm run build
   (This will take 3-5 minutes - DO NOT CANCEL!)
5. Wait for "Done building in X.XXs" message
```

### Using the Batch File:
```cmd
1. Double-click on "build-gatsby.bat" in your project folder
2. Wait for the build to complete (3-5 minutes)
3. Press any key when prompted
```

### PowerShell Method:
```powershell
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. cd "c:\WORKSPACE\azure-static-web-apps\gatsby-portfolio-blog"
3. npm run build:gatsby
4. Wait for completion
```

## Verifying Your Build

After the Gatsby build completes, check:
```cmd
dir public\
```
You should see:
- index.html
- static/ folder
- page-data/ folder
- Various other Gatsby build files

## Deployment Commands

### For Static Deployment:
```bash
# Use current setup - deploy repository root
# Azure will automatically serve index.html
```

### For Gatsby Deployment:
```bash
# After successful build, switch configs:
copy staticwebapp.config.gatsby.json staticwebapp.config.json
# Then deploy the public/ folder
```

## My Recommendation

**Start with Static Deployment** because:
1. ‚úÖ It's working perfectly right now
2. ‚úÖ Deploys instantly
3. ‚úÖ No build time required
4. ‚úÖ Shows your complete portfolio

**Upgrade to Gatsby later** when you want:
- Blog functionality
- SEO optimization
- Dynamic content management
- Advanced theming features

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Static Version Now**: Your site is ready!
2. **Try Gatsby Build**: When you have 5 minutes, run the build
3. **Compare**: See which version you prefer
4. **Choose**: Deploy whichever version meets your needs

## Build Status Check

To check if your Gatsby build is working:
1. Run the build (3-5 minutes)
2. Check if `public/index.html` is created
3. Open `public/index.html` in browser to preview
4. If it looks good, deploy the `public/` folder

Your static version is already perfect and working! üéâ
