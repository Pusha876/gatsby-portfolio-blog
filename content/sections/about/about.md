Nice to meet you! I am an aspiring Cloud Engineer and a full time dad, who believes the "right time" is when ever you make your mind up.

I wouldn't call myself a sports fanatic per say, but more like a dedicated fan. My two favorite teams are the `NY JETS` and `Chelsea FC`. If you are a fan of any of those two teams you have a friend in me ðŸ˜‰. I am an avid sports fantasy player who takes pride finishing first in fantasy football & fantasy basketball leagues. I keep active by working out five days a week. Always be stronger than your excuses. 

With that being said. For the longest time I told myself that being smart wasn't cool. In reality, the coolest thing is to have the ability to use your brain to solve problems. Now, I get a sense of pride, seeing my daughter be inspired and fearless because of my efforts to make a career change without having a safety net to guarantee success. The only guarantee in this life is the effort you put forth. Join me on my journey of learning, and self growth. Hopefully, I will inspire you to keep on <a href="https://instagram.com/pryce_law24" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><u>pushing</u></a>.
